Hi 👋, I'm Sadamori Kojaku, Assistant Professor at Binghamton University, developing computational machines that learn simplicity in complexity. I'm also leading [Contexture Lab](https://contexturelab.github.io/), where we explore continuous social reality via representation learning and network science.
