# Update the cv in my homepage

## Steps to update the CV on my homepage
- Compile the latest version of my CV (./libs/skojaku-cv/main.tex) using LaTeX by running `pdflatex main.tex` in the libs/skojaku-cv directory
- Check if the latex file for the CV was updated in the skojaku-cv repository, and if there are any pending commits, push them to the remote repository
- Copy the compiled PDF file (./libs/skojaku-cv/main.pdf) to the homepage assets directory (./assets/attachments/docs/cv/cv-skojaku.pdf)
- Commit the changes to my homepage repository with a message indicating the CV has been updated and push to the remote repository
