Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Sadamori Kojaku. I'm a (computer scientist | network scientist) working at the intersection of Network Science and Machine Learning.
I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr.~Yong-Yeol Ahn at Indiana University (IU), Bloomington. I am a former postdoc of Dr. Naoki Masuda.


# My research

Data is the "oil" that fuels a quantitative understanding and exploitation of the physical world, human behaviors and our society.
However, data is *crude*; it is often incomplete, noisy, and biased.
Algorithms trained on crude data can generate false claims and make biased decisions.
For instance, algorithms trained on social networks may learn inappropriate gender and ethical biases and influence critical human decisions such as promotion and law enforcement.
For instance, many social networks exhibit strong gender and ethnic homophily and are dominated by exceptionally popular individuals having a disproportionate share of connections.

While fairness and faithfulness of algorithms are becoming increasingly important in text and image processing,
another prevalent data type---networks---has received far less attention.
Networks are a simple and powerful representation that abstracts out various complex systems including social networks, banking networks, the Internet, food webs, and brains.
The structure of networks is critical; for example, it underpins the spreading of ideas, misinformation, and disease over social networks.
Despite the universality and critical use of network data, the faithfulness and fairness of algorithms for network data have received much less attention than they deserve.

My research aims to provide a fundamental basis for faithful and fairness-aware machine learning for networks.
This basis is graph representation learning, or embedding, which embeds a network into a vector space.
I focus on fundamental understanding of how they function, which enables us to assess and leverage their strength, and "distill" useful insights from rich but crude network data.
