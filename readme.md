I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Indiana University Bloomington since 2020. Previously, I was a Research Associate at University of Bristol (2016-2019) and Kobe University (2019-2020). I have received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Hokkaido University in 2016.

My research interest lies at the intersection between Network Science, Machine Lerning and Science of Science.
Data is the oil of in the 21st century, fueling a deep quantitative understanding of science. However, the new data-driven paradigm comes with substantial risks and challenges. Data about science is an imperfect, noisy, and biased reflection of science. Algorithms trained on the data can generate false claims and make biased decisions. Thus, algorithms that can "distill" useful and unbiased information from crude data are instrumental in the science of science.
My research has been focused on algorithms that can extract useful information from rich but noisy biased data, with the ultimate goal of better-informed decision-making in scientific enterprise. My research views science as a complex network of papers, authors, and concepts. Building on this perspective, my research program focuses on algorithms for networks.

I love sailing (470;Laser;OP), Kendo (a Japanese martial arts;3rd-Dan), and Ski. Recently, Tennis is added to my favorite sports!
