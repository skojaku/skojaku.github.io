> This hyperbolic map visualizes 1.1 million papers by 14,490 BU researchers, tracking topic shifts over time. Distance reflects specialization—outward points represent niche research. Blue and red regions show fields researchers leave and enter, respectively. The map highlights increasing specialization among BU researchers and the shifting dynamics of scientific focus.

### Charting Scientific Foraging

> Just as slime mold explores and exploits foods, so too do scientists forage for scientific discoveries. The colors represent research topics. The elevation represents the number of scientists publishing in that area. Scientists are mapped by a language model, BERT, trained on 134M scientific papers and visualized with HeliosWeb.
