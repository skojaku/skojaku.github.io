# Welcome to My Blog!

This is a sample blog post demonstrating the markdown capabilities of this Jekyll-powered blog. You can write posts in simple markdown and they'll be automatically formatted and published.

## What You Can Do

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and even `inline code`. Here's a quote:

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay

### Lists

Unordered lists:
- Network science
- Machine learning
- Data visualization
- Complex systems

Ordered lists:
1. Write your post in markdown
2. Save it in the `_posts` directory
3. Commit and push
4. Your blog is updated!

### Code Blocks

```python
# Example Python code
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple network
G = nx.karate_club_graph()
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
```

### Links and Images

You can add [links to other pages](https://skojaku.github.io) and embed images:

```markdown
![Alt text](/path/to/image.png)
```

### Math Equations

If you have MathJax or KaTeX enabled, you can write equations:

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:
$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)x_i
$$

## Next Steps

To create your own blog posts:

1. Create a new file in `_posts/` with the naming format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Add front matter at the top (the section between `---`)
3. Write your content in markdown
4. Save and commit!

Happy blogging!
