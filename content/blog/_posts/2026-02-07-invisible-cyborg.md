## Building my parts

I was daydreaming while driving to work in January 2026, thinking that things have shifted so much in the last three years. 

It brought me back to an old thought from [Phycho-Pass](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379308/). The show is about a society governed by ``digital secretaries''---AI systems that don't just help you, but manage the everything of your life. In this world, people don't just use technology; they are tethered to it. And this is happening in our world too.

I kept thinking about [Toyohisa Senguji](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E6%B3%89%E5%AE%AE%E5%AF%BA%E8%B1%8A%E4%B9%85), a character who replace every biological cell with mechanical components until he was 110 years of age and entirely synthetic. He poses a question that feels less like science fiction and more like a mirror to our current reality:

> "If you cannot live without it, is it not already a part of you?"

We tend to think of ``cyborgs'' as people with metal limbs or glowing eyes. But Senguji’s logic suggests we are already there.


 draws a future where people live with what they call ``digital secretarsy.'' It is an AI system that literally manages everything in your life. People cannot live without it. In an episode, Toyohisa Senguji---a 110-year-old man who has replaced his entire body with mechanical parts---makes this argument.

a guy (who replaced all biological components to mechanical ones) asks: if you cannot live without it, is it a part of you?

I was driving to pick up my kid from daycare, thinking that how fast my kids have grown up. 

I was driving with my family to research school districts and neighborhood, thinking that how fast my kids have grown up.
