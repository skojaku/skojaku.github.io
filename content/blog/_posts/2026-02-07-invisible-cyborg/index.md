### Building my parts

I was daydreaming, thinking about an old thought from [Phycho-Pass](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379308/). The show is about a society governed by ``digital secretaries''---AI systems that don't just help you, but manage the everything of your life. In this world, people don't just use technology; they are tethered to it. And this is happening in our world too.

In an episode, [Toyohisa Senguji](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E6%B3%89%E5%AE%AE%E5%AF%BA%E8%B1%8A%E4%B9%85), a character who replace every biological cell with mechanical components until he was 110 years of age and entirely synthetic, poses a question that feels less like science fiction now:

> "You probably have home automation and an digital secretary. What would happen to you if all the data in those devices was lost due to a disaster or accident? When you entrust so much of your everyday life to those electronic devices, the argument that you aren't a cyborg isn't very convincing. To you, those portable terminals are already your second brain. Isn't that right?"

We tend to think of ``cyborgs'' as people with metal limbs or glowing eyes. But Senguji’s logic suggests we are already there.
